## Installation

[1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diegofergamboa/coding-a-videogame-javascript.git]

## Usage

[You can explore the code examples in this repository to learn about the different features of ECMAScript. Each file focuses on a specific feature and includes relevant code snippets and explanations.]

## Features

[
    ES6: let and const, and arrow functions: This section covers the ES6 features of let and const for variable declaration and arrow functions. It may include examples of how to use these features in your project files.

    ES6: strings: This section focuses on the ES6 enhancements to string manipulation and introduces new string methods or features. It may include examples related to working with strings in your project files.

    ES6: default parameters: This section explains the ES6 feature of default parameters for function arguments. It may showcase how to define and use default parameters in your project files.

    ES6: destructuring assignment: This section covers the ES6 feature of destructuring assignment, which allows extracting values from objects or arrays into individual variables. It may demonstrate how to use destructuring assignment in your project files.

    ES6: spread operator: This section explains the spread operator in ES6, which is used to expand an iterable (such as an array) into individual elements. It may showcase how to use the spread operator in your project files.

    ES6: object literals: This section covers the ES6 enhancement to object literals, which simplifies object creation and manipulation. It may include examples related to object literals in your project files.

    ES6: promises: This section explains the concept of promises in JavaScript, which is an asynchronous programming pattern introduced in ES6. It may include examples of using promises in your project files.

    ES6: classes: This section introduces the ES6 class syntax and covers the concept of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It may include examples of defining and using classes in your project files.

    ES6: modules: This section covers ES6 modules, which provide a standardized way to organize and share JavaScript code. It may include examples of using modules in your project files.

    ES6: generators: This section explains generators in ES6, which are functions that can pause and resume their execution. It may include examples of using generators in your project files.

    ES6: Set.add: This section covers the ES6 Set object and its add method for working with unique values. It may include examples related to using sets in your project files.

    These are just some of the features mentioned, and there may be additional features covered in your course materials. Let me know if you have any further questions!
